# Git Tutorials

An incomplete collection of git tutorials that are supplemental to the [git manual](https://git-scm.com/docs) and the [git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

It is assumed that you know how to use the command line, you have git [installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), and you can access the `git` command from the command line.

This tutorial is meant to be read in the browser.
There's no need to clone this repository.
It has some [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) diagrams
that should render in GitHub.
