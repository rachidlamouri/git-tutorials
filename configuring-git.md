# Configuring Git

Instructions for configuring git can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).

Make sure to set:

- user.name
- user.email
- core.editor (see the GitHub docs for [configuring various editors](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/associating-text-editors-with-git))
